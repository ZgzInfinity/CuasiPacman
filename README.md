# CuasiPacman
Pacman 
This game has been programmed in PASCAL.
To complie and execute the game you should use windows instead of a linux distribution.
You should install an IDE if you want to work in a comfortable way instead of using the terminal.
Here I provide a zip file with an installer of an editor for Pascal in windows called dev-Pascal.
