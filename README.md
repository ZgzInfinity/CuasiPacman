# CuasiPacman
# This game has been programmed in PASCAL. 
# To complie and execute the game you should use windows instead of a linux distribution.
# You should install an IDE if you want to work in a comfortable way instead of using the terminal.
# Here I provide a zip file with an installer of an editor for Pascal in windows called dev-Pascal.
# Configure the console system with the following dimensions: 24x80 if you want to see it with good resolution.
